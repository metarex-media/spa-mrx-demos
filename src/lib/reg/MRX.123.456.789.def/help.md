# MRX.123.456.789.def - ALPHA release candidate

## frame by frame csv data of Rexy's sunbathing scene

**Congratulations**. This is a sample url that defines the content of the
metadata in the `rexy_sunbathe_mrx.mxf` file.

This is work in progress and there may be issues with the rexy file as well as
with the associated identifiers during the engineering stages.

The sample JSON below may change over time. If you want to track the changes of
the JSON for this sample, then take a look at the GitHub repo for this page.

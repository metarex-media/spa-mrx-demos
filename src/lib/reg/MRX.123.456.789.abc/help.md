# MRX.123.456.789.abc

**Congratulations**. This is the MetaRex ID for then entry in the meratex
register. It shows how a simple ID can resolve to a web page where there is
information on how to:

* check you've got the right page (`metarexId`)
* get a unique string that identifies the metarex type (`type`)
* and a set of useful keys to identify ways to enlighten the data. The
  specification and schema need to be developed during the project and Proofs of
  Concept, but potential values are:
  * `schema` links to one or more schema(s) for this metadata
  * `media-type` the `Content Type` for an HTTP POST header
  * `specification` url of a human (or machine) readable syntax &amp; semantic
    definition
  * `services` links to online services that can handle the raw or metarex
    encapsulated metadata

Take a look at the reggister entry and follow the links to the specification and
schema.
